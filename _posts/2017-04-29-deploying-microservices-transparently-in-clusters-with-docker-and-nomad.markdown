Nomad is a tool for managing a cluster of machines and running applications on them. It makes easy to decide what to deploy and which resources are needed abstracting the machines and locations. 

During this demo, we will create, dockerize and deploy our microservices with Nomad. We will simulate locally our infrastructure, scale it and shut it down to learn about the consequences that those actions imply.

## Stockholm Google Developer Group

**NOTE:** I will update this blog post with the documentation of this speech after that date.
